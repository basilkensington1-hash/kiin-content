2. **Solution**: Practical, actionable advice
3. **Context**: When/how to apply this
4. **Encouragement**: Supportive closing thought

*Example: "Feeling overwhelmed by medication schedules? Try the 'photo method' - take a picture of all medications lined up in order. Share with family members. Makes handoffs so much easier. Small systems, big relief."*

### Story Structure
1. **Setup**: Caregiving situation or challenge
2. **Journey**: What happened, decisions made
3. **Outcome**: How things improved or changed  
4. **Lesson**: Takeaway for other caregivers
